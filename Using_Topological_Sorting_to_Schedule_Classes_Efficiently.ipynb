        "\n",
        "As a student, you probably have a list of classes that you need to take in order to graduate. Also, many of those classes likely have prerequisites. Since you are not allowed to take a class before completing its prequisites, how do you figure out a correct order of classes to take? One efficient and elegant solution uses an approach called **topological sorting**. In this tutorial, we will explain how to use topological sorting to write a class-scheduling Python function."
