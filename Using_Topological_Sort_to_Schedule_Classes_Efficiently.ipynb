        "As a student, you probably have a list of classes that you need to take in order to graduate. Many of those classes also likely have prerequisites. Since you can't take a class before completing its prequisites, how do you figure out a valid sequence of classes to take? One approach uses an algorithm called **topological sorting**. In this tutorial, we will explain how to use topological sorting to write a class-scheduling Python function."
